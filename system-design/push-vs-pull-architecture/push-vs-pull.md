# Push Architecture

The most compelling scenario for employing push architecture arises when dealing with time-critical information that undergoes frequent changes, necessitating immediate updates for clients.

Push architecture facilitate the server in sending out updates to clients as soon as fresh data emerges, eliminating the requirement for clients to actively solicit it. Upon receiving new data, the server proactively transmits it to the client application, obviating the necessity for any explicit request. This characteristic renders push architecture a more efficient communication protocol particularly suited for frequently changing data.

## Use Cases Example

- Promotional Marketing, Social Media Notifications, Breaking News Alerts, Emergency Alerts

# Pull Architecture

When your client application needs to check for new information on the server side, the simplest approach, although not always the most optimal, is to make a request and inquire. This is essentially the fundamental concept behind pull architecture where the client application takes the initiative by asking for updates. The server then receives, validates, processes the request, and subsequently sends back an appropriate response to the client.

The entire process of polling for updates typically takes a few hundred milliseconds. However, when numerous requests pile up, there's a risk of slowing down or overloading the server layer, resulting in an unsatisfactory user experience, customer grievances, and even financial losses. Consequently, many companies resort to implementing rate limits to restrict how frequently a client can request the same information.

While certain disadvantages of the pull architecture can be alleviated through a system capable of distributing the processing load, this quickly escalates into a costly and resource-intensive alternative. If your goal involves the need for frequent communication of updates, the push architecture is likely a more favorable selection.

## Use Cases Example

- Weather App, News Website, Email, Learning Management System, Search Engine

# General Comparison

- Pull architecture relies on requests initiated by the client, prompting corresponding responses from the server. Conversely, push architecture operates based on events, with the server delivering data updates directly to clients.

- Push architecture server is required to retain client details for direct communication. On the contrary, pull architecture isn't required to retain client details since the request inherently contains the required information.

- Push architecture exhibit notable speed advantages over pull architecture. In pull architecture, the server follows a sequence of receiving, verifying requests, processing data, and then formulating a response sent back to the client. In push architecture, the server promptly processes data and dispatches it to clients as soon as it's ready.

# Conclusion

- System architecture often combines both push and pull methods. Different parts of an application suit different situations, so it's crucial to choose the right approach for your specific needs to make the most of your system's potential.

- In pull architecture, users actively request information, while in push architecture, information is delivered proactively to users based on events or updates.
