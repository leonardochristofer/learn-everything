# Introduction

Static site generation involves creating an entire website with fixed HTML pages using raw data and templates. Basically, it takes care of making all the HTML pages without you having to do it manually, and these pages are prepared in advance to show to visitors.

## Advantages

- With a static site generator, you can make a website that's completely based on static HTML. This means you don't need a lot of database or server work.

- Static sites are the quickest kind of web pages because they're ready to go as soon as you want to show them to people.

- Since the website is prepared ahead of time, the content is really safe.
    
- Works well with search engines, so people can find your page easily (SEO-friendly).

## Tradeoffs

- It's a bit hard to edit and put new content on static sites. Editors might need access to the code instead of an easy web app.

- When updating the website content, you have to rebuild the site, test it, and then finally put it up for people to see.

- Keeping big websites in shape with static site generation can be tough, not to mention it takes a long time to build.

## When to Use SSG?

Even though static site generation has lots of good points, it's best for websites where the content doesn't change much, like showing products on a website.

For blogs, you can use static site generation if you don't mind putting up the site again every time you want to change something.

But if your site has any kind of changing content, static site generation isn't a good idea.
