# Introduction

Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to apply static generation on a per-page basis, eliminating the need for rebuilding the entire website. This approach preserves the advantages of static websites while efficiently handling a vast number of pages.

## Advantages

- Similar to SSG, ISR is exceptionally fast by pre-rendering and caching pages.

- You can modify content without the necessity to redeploy the entire site.
    
- Works well with search engines, so people can find your page easily (SEO-friendly).

## Tradeoffs

- One major limitation of ISR is that users might see outdated content if they visit the site after content changes but before the new version of the site is available.

## When to Use ISR?

ISR is best suited for websites with dynamic content that doesn't change frequently.
