# Introduction

Client-side rendering (CSR) is a method of creating web pages using JavaScript directly in your web browser. Instead of the server handling all the work, the browser manages tasks like logic, data retrieval, template creation, and determining navigation within the website. In CSR, the server provides the browser with a basic page and a bundle of JavaScript that handles all the processing.

## Advantages

- Facilitates the creation of dynamic content pages.

- Does not lead to high server costs, unlike Static Site Generation (SSG).

- Subsequent page loads after the initial one are very fast.

## Tradeoffs

- Doesn't work well if you want people to find your page easily on search engines (like Google).

- Slower initial page loading and time taken to become interactive, resulting in poorer performance.

## When to Use CSR?

If you don't care much about people finding your page on Google and such, CSR can be great.
