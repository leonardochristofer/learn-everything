# How HTTP Request Works:

## User Initiates Request:
    
The process starts when a user enters a URL in the address bar or clicks on a link or button that leads to a new web page.

## DNS Resolution:

The browser first needs to translate the human-readable URL (e.g., www.example.com) into an IP address, which is the actual numerical address of the server on the internet. This translation is done through the Domain Name System (DNS) resolution.

## Establishing a Connection:

Once the browser has the IP address of the server, it opens a network connection (usually using TCP/IP) to the server on the specified port (default is port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS).

## Sending the HTTP Request:

The browser sends an HTTP request to the server. The request includes the method (e.g., GET, POST), the URL, and any additional headers or data needed for the request.

## Server Processes the Request:

The web server on the other end (e.g., Apache, Nginx) receives the HTTP request from the browser and processes it. The server looks for the requested resource on its file system or runs server-side scripts to generate the response dynamically.

## Generating the Response:

Depending on the request, the server generates an HTTP response, which typically includes a status code indicating the success or failure of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) and the content (HTML, images, CSS) to be sent back to the browser.

## Sending the HTTP Response:

The server sends the HTTP response back to the browser over the same network connection established earlier.

## Receiving and Rendering the Response:
        
The browser receives the HTTP response. If the response contains HTML content, the browser parses the HTML, fetches additional resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript referenced in the HTML, and renders the web page on the user's screen.

## Rendering the Web Page:

The browser displays the rendered web page, and the user can interact with the content, click on links, fill out forms, and perform other actions.

## Closing the Connection:

Once the HTTP response is fully received, the browser closes the network connection to the server.

## Conclusion:

In summary, when a user initiates an HTTP request by entering a URL or clicking a link, the browser sends the request to the server, receives the response, and then renders the web page for the user to interact with. This process allows users to access and view web pages on the internet with the help of browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and others.
