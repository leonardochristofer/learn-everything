# How HTTP Request Works:

## User Initiates Request:
    
The process starts when a user enters a URL in the address bar or clicks on a link or button that leads to a new web page.

## DNS Resolution:

The browser first needs to translate the human-readable URL (e.g., www.example.com) into an IP address, which is the actual numerical address of the server on the internet. This translation is done through the Domain Name System (DNS) resolution.

### Here's a detailed flow of the DNS resolution process:
    
Imagine you want to visit a website, let's say "www.example.com." To access the website, your computer needs to find the IP address associated with this domain name so that it knows where to send the request. Here's what happens behind the scenes:

#### Step 1: The Request:

You type "www.example.com" in your web browser and hit Enter. Your computer now needs the IP address of "www.example.com" to proceed.

#### Step 2: Checking the Cache:

Your computer checks its local DNS cache, a temporary storage where it keeps previously resolved domain names and their corresponding IP addresses. If the IP address for "www.example.com" is already in the cache, great! The computer can proceed to access the website directly.

#### Step 3: Recursive Query:

If the IP address is not in the cache, your computer sends a request to a DNS resolver, which is like a phone book for domain names.

#### Step 4: Asking the Root Server:
        
The DNS resolver doesn't have the IP address either, so it starts the resolution process by asking the root DNS servers, which are like the root of the internet's domain name system.

#### Step 5: Directions to TLD Server:

The root DNS servers don't know the specific IP address for "www.example.com" but they can tell the resolver which Top-Level Domain (TLD) server handles the ".com" part of the domain.

#### Step 6: Asking the TLD Server:

The resolver then contacts the TLD server responsible for ".com" domains and asks for more information about "www.example.com."

#### Step 7: Directions to Authoritative Server:
        
The TLD server doesn't have the exact IP address either, but it can direct the resolver to the authoritative name servers responsible for the "example.com" domain.

#### Step 8: Asking the Authoritative Server:
        
The resolver finally contacts the authoritative name servers for "example.com" and requests the IP address for "www.example.com."

#### Step 9: The Response:

The authoritative name servers respond with the IP address of "www.example.com."

#### Step 10: Caching the Response:
        
The resolver caches the IP address it received, so it won't need to go through the entire resolution process again if someone else asks for "www.example.com" soon after.

#### Step 11: Website Access:
        
With the IP address, your computer can now access "www.example.com," and you can see the website on your browser.

That's the basic idea of how DNS resolution works. It's like a series of inquiries that start from the root of the internet's domain name system and gradually narrow down to the authoritative source for the specific domain you're looking for. The system is efficient, so once the IP address is found, it's cached for faster access in the future.

## Establishing a Connection:

Once the browser has the IP address of the server, it opens a network connection (usually using TCP/IP) to the server on the specified port (default is port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS).

## Sending the HTTP Request:

The browser sends an HTTP request to the server. The request includes the method (e.g., GET, POST), the URL, and any additional headers or data needed for the request.

## Server Processes the Request:

The web server on the other end (e.g., Apache, Nginx) receives the HTTP request from the browser and processes it. The server looks for the requested resource on its file system or runs server-side scripts to generate the response dynamically.

## Generating the Response:

Depending on the request, the server generates an HTTP response, which typically includes a status code indicating the success or failure of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) and the content (HTML, images, CSS) to be sent back to the browser.

## Sending the HTTP Response:

The server sends the HTTP response back to the browser over the same network connection established earlier.

## Receiving and Rendering the Response:
        
The browser receives the HTTP response. If the response contains HTML content, the browser parses the HTML, fetches additional resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript referenced in the HTML, and renders the web page on the user's screen.

## Rendering the Web Page:

The browser displays the rendered web page, and the user can interact with the content, click on links, fill out forms, and perform other actions.

## Closing the Connection:

Once the HTTP response is fully received, the browser closes the network connection to the server.

## Conclusion:

In summary, when a user initiates an HTTP request by entering a URL or clicking a link, the browser sends the request to the server, receives the response, and then renders the web page for the user to interact with. This process allows users to access and view web pages on the internet with the help of browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and others.
