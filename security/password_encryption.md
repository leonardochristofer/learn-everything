## Introduction
Password encryption is a critical aspect of security when it comes to storing and managing user passwords in computer systems. The primary goal of password encryption is to protect user credentials and sensitive information from unauthorized access, ensuring that even if the system's database is compromised, attackers cannot easily obtain the original passwords. To achieve this, passwords are transformed into a non-reversible form, making it challenging for attackers to reverse-engineer or "decrypt" them back to their original plaintext form.

## Why Password Encryption is Necessary:
- Confidentiality: Passwords are sensitive information that must remain confidential. Users often reuse passwords across multiple systems, so if one system is compromised, the attacker could potentially gain access to other services.

- Protection Against Database Breaches: Databases can be compromised due to various vulnerabilities or attacks. Without encryption, attackers can read the passwords in plain text, exposing user accounts and potentially leading to identity theft or unauthorized access.

- Compliance and Trust: Many regulations and best practices require organizations to protect user data, including passwords. Proper password encryption helps demonstrate compliance with data protection regulations and fosters trust among users.

## How Password Encryption Works:

### Hashing: 

One of the most common techniques for password encryption is hashing. Hashing is a one-way function that takes an input (the password) and produces a fixed-length, irreversible string of characters known as a hash value or digest. The hash value represents the encrypted password.

Example:

Password: "MySecurePassword123"

Hashed Value (SHA-256): "b13ba0e2c3251b4a07e98e7999f319c4a5816a06ea745cf8af399aa3e6702d9b"

In this example, the password "MySecurePassword123" is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm, resulting in the 64-character hash value.

#### Advantages: 

- Fast computation: Hashing algorithms are designed for efficiency, making them quick to compute.

- Irreversibility: Hashing is a one-way process, making it challenging to reverse-engineer the original password from the hash.

- Fixed-length output: Regardless of input size, hashing produces a fixed-length output, making it convenient for storage and comparison.
    
#### Tradeoffs:

- Vulnerable to rainbow table attacks: Without salting, hashing alone can be susceptible to precomputed tables (rainbow tables) that store common password hashes for quick lookups. For more details can be found here: https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/rainbow-table

### Salting:

To enhance security, a unique random value known as a "salt" is added to the password before hashing. The salt ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hash values will differ. Salting is essential to prevent attackers from using precomputed tables like rainbow tables to crack multiple hashes simultaneously.

Example:

Password: "MySecurePassword123"

Salt: "9jS2bZ"

Step 1: Concatenate the password and the salt: "MySecurePassword1239jS2bZ"

Step 2: Hash the concatenated value using SHA-256, Hashed Value (SHA-256): "7f9cfd7b74006a1b285db9781223e0484ed6e3be99260aeb693ab95c60a041af"

In this example, the salt "9jS2bZ" is added to the password "MySecurePassword123" before hashing, resulting in a different 64-character hash value.

#### Advantages:

- Protection against rainbow tables: Salting adds uniqueness to each password, preventing the use of precomputed tables.

- Increased security: Salting makes it more time-consuming and resource-intensive for attackers to crack passwords through brute force attacks.
    
#### Tradeoffs:

- Requires additional storage: Salts need to be stored alongside the hashes, increasing the overall storage requirement.

### Key Derivation Functions (KDFs):

A Key Derivation Function is a cryptographic function used to derive a secure encryption key from a password. KDFs are designed to be computationally expensive and slow to prevent brute-force attacks.

#### Advantages:

- Slows down brute-force attacks: KDFs are designed to be computationally expensive, significantly slowing down attackers attempting to guess passwords.

- Configurable complexity: KDFs allow for parameter tuning to adjust the computational cost based on hardware capabilities and security requirements.

#### Tradeoffs:

- Increased computation time: The computational overhead can affect the performance of login systems when verifying passwords.

### Common KDFs include bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2 (https://stytch.com/blog/argon2-vs-bcrypt-vs-scrypt)

### bcrypt:

bcrypt is a widely used password hashing algorithm that is designed to be computationally expensive and slow, which makes it resilient against brute-force attacks and parallel computation.

#### Advantages:

- Slow and computationally expensive: bcrypt is intentionally designed to be slow, making it difficult and time-consuming for attackers to perform exhaustive search attacks.

- Adaptive hashing: bcrypt allows for the specification of the "work factor" (cost factor), which determines the number of iterations the algorithm performs. As hardware improves, the work factor can be increased to maintain the desired level of security.

- Salting: bcrypt automatically generates and handles salts for each password, providing additional protection against rainbow table attacks.

#### Tradeoffs:

- Relatively older algorithm: While it's still considered secure, newer algorithms like Argon2 and scrypt have been developed to address potential weaknesses.

### scrypt:

scrypt is a password-based key derivation function (PBKDF) that is designed to be memory-intensive and resistant to parallel computation. It aims to provide strong security against brute-force attacks.

#### Advantages:

- Memory-hardness: scrypt requires a significant amount of memory to perform its computations, making it less susceptible to attacks that rely on fast computations.
    
- CPU and memory requirements: By tuning the parameters (cost factors), scrypt allows balancing the CPU and memory requirements, making it adaptable to different hardware environments.

#### Tradeoffs:

- Complexity: The complexity of scrypt can make it harder to implement and configure correctly compared to simpler algorithms like bcrypt.

- Less widespread adoption: While scrypt is well-regarded, it is not as widely adopted as bcrypt, which may lead to a smaller community of users testing and scrutinizing its security.

### Argon2:

Argon2 is a memory-hard and highly customizable password hashing algorithm designed to be secure against various attack vectors.

#### Advantages:

- Cutting-edge security: Argon2 is the latest and most rigorously vetted algorithm, making it the preferred choice for new applications and security-conscious developers.
    
- Configurability: Argon2 offers various parameters (time cost, memory cost, parallelism) that can be adjusted based on hardware capabilities to tune the algorithm's security and performance.

#### Tradeoffs:

- Newer algorithm: Being relatively new, Argon2 may not have the same level of long-term scrutiny and real-world testing as bcrypt, which has been around for a longer period.
    
- Implementation complexity: Argon2's flexibility and configurability can lead to implementation errors if not used correctly.

## Conclusion

In summary, password encryption is crucial for protecting user credentials and ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information. By using hashing, salting, and key derivation functions, organizations can significantly improve the security of their systems and user data. However, it's essential to keep in mind that encryption is just one layer of security, strong authentication practices and regular security audits is necessary for a more secure system. **Always remember, no system is secure.**
